\section*{Large Scale Image Classification} 

\texttt{Briefly describe the steps used to produce the solution. Feel free to add plots or screenshots if you think it's necessary. The report should contain a maximum of 2 pages.
Keep in mind that you only have to submit one report per group. Please indicate the contribution of each group member to the project.}

\paragraph{Problem formulation.\!\!\!}
The goal of this project was to use a SVM to classify a set of images into whether they are images of people, or images of nature. The images were provided in the form of pre-computed feature vectors. 

\paragraph{Approach.\!\!\!}


\paragraph{Mapper.\!\!\!}
Performs the online svm using \emph{Stochastic Gradient Descent}. (passes sum of $w$ on to reducer)

\paragraph{Reducer.\!\!\!}
Creates a weighted average of the $w$ passed by the mappers.

\paragraph{Learning lambda.\!\!\!}
Cross validation

\paragraph{Results.\!\!\!}


\paragraph{Workload distribution.\!\!\!}
